Upcoming IPO Webpage

This project is a web page designed to display a list of upcoming IPOs in a clean and easy-to-read format. It shows important details about each IPO, such as the company name, dates, and status.

The page is made to be user-friendly and works well on both desktop and mobile screens. It is part of my internship and will be improved further with more features like search, filters, and better design updates as development continues.
